# Problem Solving

**Domain must be:**
```
1. Fully Observable: One must be able to see what initial statement one start out with.
2. Known: One have to know the set of available actions.
3. Discrete: There must be a finite number of actions to choose from.
4. Deterministic: One have to know the result of taking an action.
5. Static: There must no be anything in the world that can change the world except our own actions
```

### The Turing Test
```
The test was designed by Allan Turing in 1950 to provide a satisfactory operational definition of intelligence. A computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person or from a computer.
```
• **Natural Language Processing**: to enable it to communicate successfully in English.
• **Knowledge Representation**: to store what it knows or hears.
• **Automated Reasoning**: to use the stored information to answer questions and to draw new conclusions.
• **Machine Learning**: to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns.

### Total Turing Test
```
This also includes phisical test such as a video signal so that the interrogator can test the subject’s perceptual abilities, as well as the opportunity for the interrogator to pass physical objects “through the hatch.” To pass the total Turing Test, the computer will need:
```
• **Computer Vision**: to perceive objects.
• **Robotics**: to manipulate objects and move about.
