**Domain must be:**
```
1. **Fully Observable**: One must be able to see what initial statement one start out with.
2. **Known**: One have to know the set of available actions.
3. **Discrete**: There must be a finite number of actions to choose from.
4. **Deterministic**: One have to know the result of taking an action.
5. **Static**: There must no be anything in the world that can change the world except our own actions
```
